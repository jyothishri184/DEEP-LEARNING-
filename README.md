## About the Project

Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer is focused on recognizing hand gestures of alphabets. This Model is initiative to promote accessibility and communication inclusivity, breaking down barriers for the hearing-impaired. I am enthusiastic about learning and dedicated to continuous development to this model to grow further.
