## About the Repo

Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer is focused on recognizing hand gestures of alphabets. I am enthusiastic about learning and dedicated to continuous development to this model to grow further. The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively test the model with custom images.

## About CNN 

What are CNNs?

Convolutional Neural Networks are designed for tasks involving images. üñºÔ∏è

Key Components:

- Convolutional Layers: Extract features from input images.
- Pooling Layers: Downsample the extracted features, preserving essential information.
- Fully Connected Layers: Process flattened feature maps for final predictions.
- Activation Functions: Utilize functions like ReLU to introduce non-linearity.

Training Process:
CNNs are trained through backpropagation, adjusting weights during training to improve performance.
